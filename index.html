								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/portfolio-pic-smallest-size.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>As a dynamic Full-Stack Software Engineer, I blend a unique background in Biology and hands-on experience as an Emergency Medical Technician with comprehensive training in software development from App Academy. My journey through the realms of Biology and healthcare has instilled in me a profound appreciation for complex systems and analytical problem-solving, skills I now apply to the technology sector. My decision to transition from a path in healthcare to software engineering was fueled by a desire to make a broader impact through technology. During my intensive training in 2023, I mastered a range of technologies such as JavaScript, React, Redux, Node.js, Express.js, Sequelize, Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, HTML, and CSS. This experience has equipped me with not only a strong technical skillset but also an agile and adaptive mindset, essential in the fast-paced world of tech.
									What drives me is the prospect of integrating my understanding of biological systems and emergency medical response with cutting-edge software solutions. I am passionate about contributing to projects that leverage technology to improve the quality of life, echoing my commitment to meaningful work that resonates with my background in healthcare and science.</p>
